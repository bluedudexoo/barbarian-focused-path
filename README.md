# Path of the Focused Flame 
### These Barbarians took cues from the Monks- channeling their bloodlust into a deadly, purposeful intent that ignites on entering a rage.


## Explosive Intent
- At the 3rd level after entering a rage, your first attack every turn during
  your rage will have additional fire damage equal to [proficency score] d4s. 
  If this first attack hits, your first attack next turn will deal an additional
  d4 of fire damage. This effect stacks up to a number of times equal to your
  strength modifier.
- When you enter a rage, if an enemy is within 5 feet of you, they must make a
  constitution saving throw. On a fail, they are stunned for the next 12
  seconds; on a save, they are knocked back 5 feet from you and are prone.


## Fiery Grip
- Beginning at the 6th level, you gain the ability to cast Burning Hands at the
  1st level. Strength is your spellcasting ability for this spell. This 
  increases to the 2nd level at level 10, and the 3rd level at level 14. 
- After you cast this spell in this way, you can't use this feature
  again until you have completed a long or short rest.


## Warm Glow
- Beginning at 10th level, while you are raging, any ally within 10 feet of you
  gains resistance to piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage. This effect
  lasts for as long as the ally is within 10 feet of you, or if your rage ends.
- At the 14th and 20th level, this feature's area of effect increases by 5 feet.


## Defensive Hearth
- At the 14th level, while an ally is affected by your Warm Glow, you both have
  advantage on constitution saving throws and ability checks, and can use a
  reaction to enjoy the warmth and gain temporary hit points equal to your
  constitution modifier. This feature's temporary hit point gain can only take
  effect once per combat.
