# Path of the Focused Flame 
### These Barbarians took cues from the Monks- channeling their bloodlust into a deadly, purposeful intent that ignites on entering a rage.


## Explosive Intent
- At the 3rd level while raging, your first attack that hits every turn deals an
  extra d4 of fire damage. For each successive attack that hits and is modified
  in this way, your first attack that hits on the next turn gains an additional
  d4 of fire damage. This effect stacks up to a number of times equal to your
  strength modifier, and is only lost when your rage ends.
- When you enter a rage, if an enemy is within 5 feet of you, they must make a
  constitution saving throw. On a fail, they are knocked back 5 feet and are
  prone.


## Fiery Grip
- Beginning at the 6th level, you gain the ability to cast Burning Hands as a 
  bonus action at the 1st level. This increases to the 2nd level at level 10,
  and the 3rd level at level 14. Strength is your spellcasting ability for 
  this spell. 
- After you cast this spell in this way, you can't use this feature again until
  you have completed a long or short rest.


## Controlled Demolition
- At the 10th level, when you hit an enemy and deal extra fire damage from
  Explosive Intent, each enemy within 10 feet of your target takes a d6 of
  fire damage.


## Defensive Hearth
- Beginning at 14th level when you enter a rage, any ally within 30 feet of you
  that you can see gains advantage on constitution and strength saving throws
  for 1 minute, and gains temporary hit points equal to your constitution
  modifier.
