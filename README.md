# Path of the Focused Flame 
### These Barbarians took cues from the Monks- channeling their bloodlust into a deadly, purposeful intent that ignites on entering a rage.


## Explosive Intent
- At the 3rd level while raging, your first attack every turn will deal extra
  fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus. If this attack hits, your
  first attack next turn gains additional fire damage equal to your proficiency
  bonus. This effect stacks up to a number of times equal to your strength
  modifier, and is only lost when your rage ends.
- When you enter a rage, if an enemy is within 5 feet of you, they must make a
  constitution saving throw. On a fail, they are stunned for the next 12
  seconds; on a save, they are knocked back 5 feet from you and are prone.


## Fiery Grip
- Beginning at the 6th level, you gain the ability to cast Burning Hands at the
  1st level. This increases to the 2nd level at level 10, and the 3rd level at
  level 14. Strength is your spellcasting ability for this spell. 
- After you cast this spell in this way, you can't use this feature again until
  you have completed a long or short rest.


## Warm Glow
- Beginning at 10th level, while you are raging, any ally within 10 feet of you
  gains resistance to piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage. This effect
  lasts until the ally leaves its area of effect, or if your rage ends. At the
  14th and 20th level, this feature's area of effect increases by 5 feet.


## Defensive Hearth
- At the 14th level, while an ally is affected by your Warm Glow, you both have
  advantage on constitution saving throws and ability checks, and gain temporary
  hit points equal to your constitution modifier. You and your allies may only
  gain temporary hit points in this way once per combat.
