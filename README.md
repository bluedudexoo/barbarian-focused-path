# Path of the Focused Flame
### These Barbarians took cues from the Monks- channeling their bloodlust into a 
    deadly, purposeful intent that ignites on entering a rage.


## Explosive Intent
- At the 3rd level after entering a rage, your first attack every turn during
  your rage will have additional fire damage equal to [proficency score] d6. If
  this first attack hits, your first attack next turn will deal an additional d6
  of fire damage. This effect stacks up to [strength mod] times.
- When you enter a rage, if an enemy is within 5 feet of you, they must make a
  constitution saving throw. Upon a fail, they are stunned until the beginning
  of their next turn; on a save, they are knocked back 5 feet from you and are
  prone.


## Fiery Grip
- Beginning at the 6th level, you gain the ability to cast Burning Hands at the
  1st level [proficency bonus] times per short rest. This increases to the 2nd
  level at level 10, and the 3rd level at level 14.


## Warm Glow
- Beginning at 10th level, while you are raging, any ally within 10 feet of you
  gains resistance to piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage. This effect
  lasts for as long as the ally is within 10 feet of you, or if your rage ends.


## Defensive Hearth
- Beginning at the 14th level, your Warm Glow effect's range increases to 20
  feet. Additionally, while affected by your Warm Glow, allies gain 1d6 fire
  damage on all melee attacks.
