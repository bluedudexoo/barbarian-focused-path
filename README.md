# Path of the Focused Flame 
### These Barbarians took cues from the Monks- channeling their bloodlust into a deadly, purposeful intent that ignites on entering a rage.


## Explosive Intent
- At the 3rd level while raging, your first attack every turn will deal extra
  fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus. If this attack hits, your first
  attack next turn gains an additional d4 of fire damage. This effect stacks up
  to a number of times equal to your strength modifier, and is only lost when
  your rage ends.
- When you enter a rage, if an enemy is within 5 feet of you, they must make a
  constitution saving throw. On a fail, they are stunned for the next 12
  seconds; on a save, they are knocked back 5 feet from you and are prone.


## Fiery Grip
- Beginning at the 6th level, you gain the ability to cast Burning Hands at the
  1st level. This increases to the 2nd level at level 10, and the 3rd level at
  level 14. Strength is your spellcasting ability for this spell. 
- After you cast this spell in this way, you can't use this feature again until
  you have completed a long or short rest.


## Controlled Demolition
- At the 10th level, when you hit an enemy and deal extra fire damage from
  Explosive Intent, each enemy within 5 feet of your target takes a d4 of
  fire damage.


## Defensive Hearth
- Beginning at 14th level, when you enter a rage, any ally within 30 feet of you 
  that you can see gains advantage on constitution ability checks and saving
  throws for 1 minute, and gains tempoprary hit points equal to your
  constitution modifier.
